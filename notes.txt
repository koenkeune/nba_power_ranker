leaguestandings and other stats will be useful to use if you only do live updates, non-live updates should do this themselves

rankings are every week, you can choose which day of the week


look at elo system




rank first game:
start with the best teams of last season, with win_pct or scoring margin

problems:
how to translate a scoring margin to a new ranking, compare to scoring margin difference between the two teams?
	- then ranking should be a point system that tries to approximate p(team_a|team_x) for all x, maybe percentage points and after every game add and substracts percentage points
